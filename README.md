# Tools

This repository contains a collection of online tools, calculators, and visualizers designed to assist with various computational and theoretical tasks.

## Features

- **Universal Scalability Law Calculator**: This tool allows you to calculate the scalability of a system based on the Universal Scalability Law. It can help you understand how your system will perform as it scales.

- **Amdahl's Law Calculator**: This tool provides a way to calculate the maximum improvement to an overall system when only part of the system is improved. It's based on Amdahl's Law, a formula which is used to find the maximum improvement possible by improving a particular part of a system.

- **Queuing Theory Visualizer**: This tool visualizes various aspects of queuing theory, a mathematical study of waiting lines or queues. It can help you understand and optimize systems that involve processing large numbers of requests, such as customer service centers, telecommunications, and computer processing.
